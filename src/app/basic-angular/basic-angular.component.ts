  {name:`Two-way Data Binding`,details:`two-way binding is a mechanism where data flows from the component 
  to the view and back. This binding ensures that the component and view are always in sync.
   Any changes made on either end are immediately reflected on both. The general syntax to
   denote two-way data binding is a combination of Square brackets and parentheses "[()]". `,example:`<input [(ngModel)]="random" type="text"> <br>`}]
